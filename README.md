GoGive
======

A Battlehack London project. GoGive is a directory of high-street charitable organisations looking for donations. Twilio integration helps charities engage their donors when they're most in need, with real-time text notifications

The website is currently live at http://gogive.co, please note that **the data in there is not accurate or heavily curated**. It was gleaned using import.io's awesome tools, but munged a bit in order to make it usable for the demo.

## Contributing

GoGive isn't finished yet, but it's half-way there. If you're interested in contributing, this is what we need:

* An interface for Charities to sign up and update their details. It could be as simple as giving them a secret link (and maybe a passcode) to manage their charity
* An improved landing page which allows for text search and explains that the places listed are in order of proximity to the user
* Slightly better communication using Twilio SMS

## Credits

This is a hack created at PayPal Developer's BattleHack 2013 in London, UK. It is the product of sweat, tears, cupcakes, sweets, coffee, tea, overpowered cocktails, and the hard work of these fine fellows:

* Alun Davey ([@4lun](http://github.com/4lun))
* Jon Finerty ([@jf0873](http://github.com/4lun))
* Dan Hough ([@basicallydan](http://github.com/4lun))
