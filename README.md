This is a hack created at PayPal Developer's BattleHack 2013 in London, UK. It is the product of sweat, tears, cupcakes, sweets, coffee, tea, overpowered cocktails, and the hard work of these fine fellows:

* Alun Davey ([@4lun](http://github.com/4lun))
* Jon Finerty ([@jf0873](http://github.com/4lun))
* Dan Hough ([@basicallydan](http://github.com/4lun))
